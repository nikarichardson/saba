<h1>Operating Systems</h1>
<h2>What is an operating system? </h2>

Virtualization is the process of taking a physical resource and making it virtual in order to duplicate the resource. This process allows multiple programs to run by sharing the CPU. Thus, the memory is effectively <i>private</i> to each running program, not a communal resource. Virtualization duplicates the CPU as many times as necessary for the operating system. The CPU is the single principle processor of an <b>operating system</b>. Design of operating systems must take into account the minimization of overheads (excess use of memory or space) while optimizing its performance. <b>Von Neumann method of computing:</b> fetching an instruction, decoding it, and executing it. The operating system manages the various resources that are employed in the [operation]. The resources of that the operating system manages includes the CPU, the memory, and the disk. 
	When an operating system virtualizes memory, each running program uses a virtual address space that is mapped onto the machineâ€™s memory. Memory is an array of bytes that can be read (accessed) or written (updated.) 

The file system stores the files on disk and is primarily concerned with the persistence of these files (that is, the reliability of filesâ€™ persistence). Persistent storage is key to a userâ€™s ability to retrieve data in the wake of a system failure. The file system receives system calls and [grants] the requests. 
<b>Concurrency</b> refers to the concurrent operation of multiple processes in operating systems. Many issues can arise when programs run concurrently, like the conflict of variable values and the overwriting of important data.
